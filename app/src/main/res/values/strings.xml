        Gomoku is a two-player board game. Each player has a type
        of stone, black or white. In each turn, a player places a
        stone at a corner in the board. The winner must have a line
        of first five adjacent stones vertically, horizontally, or
        diagonally. This line must not be blocked at both ends.
        The edge of the board is considered as a blocked end. In
        standard mode, a line of six  or  more  adjacent stones does
        not count. In freestyle mode, a line of six or more adjacent
        stones is allowed.
